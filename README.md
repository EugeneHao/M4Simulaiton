# M4Simulaiton
Simulation study for Multivariate Mixed-outcome Mixed-effect Model

We have three folders of codes for three different simulations:
1.	Bivariate Code:1 binary variable and 1 continuous variable
2.	CategYOneZ: 1 categorical variable and 1 continuous variable
3.	MultiYMultiZ: several categorical variables and several continuous variables
We do not show the codes for real data because of data privacy
